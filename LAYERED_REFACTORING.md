# AST SimHash Detector - Layered Architecture Refactoring

## Overview
Refactored the monolithic `ASTSimHashDetectorRefactored` class into a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Architecture

### Before (Monolithic)
- Single class with 523 lines
- Mixed responsibilities
- Difficult to test and maintain

### After (Layered)
```
ast_simhash_detector_layered.py (Facade)
    ├── DataManagementLayer
    ├── SimilarityDetectionLayer
    ├── GraphConstructionLayer
    └── StatisticsAnalysisLayer
```

## Benefits
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each layer has one clear purpose
2. **Testability**: Layers can be tested independently
3. **Maintainability**: Changes are localized to specific layers
4. **Reusability**: Layers can be used independently

## Migration
Use `migrate_to_layered.py` for smooth transition from old to new architecture.
